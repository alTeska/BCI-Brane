Notes steffan meeting 29.06:
CCA
1. maximize the correlation from all channels and try to maximize correlation between target signal and what is present in the signal
a) intrinsic dimentionality reduction
b) FFT and just the target frequencies 
6 electrodes
6 harmonics

take all the signals and end up with one correlation value from that target

compare with target signals correlation
-> correlation for all channels
-> 

Suggestions:
1. compute wavelenght time frequency transform and visualize a few epochs, pick should be arising at some point
(this epoch belongs)

2. throw out first second 
3. then subdivide into few epochs, possible fluctuations due to the attention

pick can depend on a person and trial, pick does not have to coherent

SVM -> not some decent  results 60/70%
CCA -> won't get better, could go to 80% (outperform with standard approach)

TODO:
1. look at epochs - if it's not visible in some epochs, maybe something is wrong with this data
2. SVM/other simple clasifier -> FFT plus certain bands, SVM should deal with all features
	a) test first with base features
	b) enable feature selection (+10% in our case)

* confusion matrix to see, maybe there is confusion between two particular classes

NOTES ABOUT SSVEP:
distance, glasses, focus
