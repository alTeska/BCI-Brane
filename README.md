# EEG robot control

This project is a part of the  Biosignals Processing class at Technical University of Munich.
Goal: Development of EEG based BCI, used for control of a robot.


#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective

* Repetitive Visual Stimuli (RVS)
* Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP)
* Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
* LDA and SVM

### Technologies
* Python
* [ratCAVE](https://github.com/ratcave)
* Pandas, jupyter, sklearn
* OpenVibe
* arduino

In this project we focused on implementing a system that is capable to control an arduino based robot with EMOTIV EPOC+ EEG headset. The data was acquired with use of OpenVibe software and later on streamed to the Python script. The SSVEP experiment was designed in two ways, first one internally (used for final working implementation) and second one solely in ratCAVE, for possible migration to only Python based approach.

The second part of the pipeline was responsible for band-pass filtering, feature extraction and classification. For the final implementation I implemented CCA algorithm based on which SVM classification was applied.
